                <p class="para-style"> Last August, I (1) <InputAnswer/>(go) to Ella, a beautiful hill station in Sri Lanka, for a vacation. 
                    I (2) <InputAnswer/>(travel) there with my family. The journey took several hours by train.
                    While we (3) <InputAnswer/>(enjoy) the scenic views from the train, I (4) <InputAnswer/>(feel) a sense of excitement. When we (5) <InputAnswer/>(arrive) 
                    in Ella, the weather was perfect â€“ the sun was shininig and a cool breeze (6) <InputAnswer/>(blow). We (7) <InputAnswer/>(stay) in a cozy 
                    cottage with stunning views of the surrounding tea plantations. During our stay, we (8) <InputAnswer/>(explore) the area by hiking to 
                    Little Adam's Peak and (9) <InputAnswer/>(visit) the Nine Arch Bridge. Each moment seemed like a new adventure. We (10) <InputAnswer/>(capture) 
                    many photos to remember the trip. Overall, my vacation in Ella was an unforgettable experience that I will cherish forever.</p>
